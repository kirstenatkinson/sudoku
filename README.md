# Sudoku Project

## URLs
Live Site: https://kirstenatkinson.github.io/sudoku/
Dosuku API: https://sudoku-api.vercel.app/

## Description

This my final challenge project for my Web Design II class. The main focus of this project was to produce a site with a functioning Sudoku game application using the Dosuku API.

## Challenge

- I am much more comfortable with focusing on the CSS of applications. This project will force me to shift my time and focus to the JavaScript side of building a webpage.
